# 🧑‍💼 End-to-End HR Analytics Project
This repository contains the files and analysis for a data analytics project focused on gaining crucial insights into Employee Attrition. The primary goal is to visualize attrition volume and distribution across various segments, and to calculate essential business metrics (KPIs) to drive effective retention strategies.
## 🌟 Project Goal
To analyze historical employee data and create interactive dashboards that visualize the total volume of attrition, its distribution by department, age, education, and marital status, and deliver actionable recommendations to management based on the segment with the highest counts.
## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following metrics were calculated to assess overall business performance:
1. Employee Count: The total number of employees in the workforce.
2. Attrition Count: The total number of employees who have left the organization.
3. Attrition Rate: The measure of the overall turnover level, calculated as the Attrition Count divided by the Employee Count.
4. Active Employees: The current number of employees actively working.
5. Average Age: The mean age of the current employee population.
## 📊 Charts and Visualizations
1. Total Attrition Count: Single tile KPI establishing the turnover volume baseline (237).
2. Attrition by Department: Chart highlighting the department with the highest count of leavers (e.g., Sales: 133).
3. Attrition by Education Field: Chart analyzing turnover volume based on employees' highest education level (e.g., Bachelor's Degree: 99).
4. Attrition by Age Group: Chart to pinpoint age cohorts with the highest count of departure (e.g., Age 26-35: 86).
5. Attrition by Marital Status: Chart exploring which marital status group has the highest volume of leavers.
## 🛠️ Technology Stack
1. Data Source: CSV file 
2. Database: PostgreSQL SQL (Used for data storage, setup, and QA validation)
3. Analysis/Manipulation: SQL (For data integrity and query development)
4. Visualization/Dashboard: Power BI, Tableau, and Excel (Used for creating multi-platform interactive dashboards)

## 💡 Conclusion and Key Insights
This project delivered actionable HR intelligence through validated, multi-platform dashboards.
1. Critical Risk Segments: Analysis revealed a crisis in young talent retention, evidenced by the $52.63\%$ attrition rate in the Under 25 age group, and a high-volume issue in the Sales Department ($\mathbf{56.12\%}$ of total attrition).
2. Strategic Need: Findings demand targeted intervention, such as reviewing compensation for young hires and conducting localized reviews within Sales.
3. Technical Reliability: The solution ensured data integrity through PostgreSQL SQL QA testing and provided versatile reporting across Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, enabling all stakeholders to access reliable performance metrics.
